TODO

- [x] Get raw login packet sent and recv a response (52 bytes)
- [x] Start building out structs+readers for login request/response
- [x] Refactor to work on tokio.rs and run multiple clients
- [ ] Figure out hashing
- [ ] Refactor packet sending code into something more generic
- [ ] Get a character list
- [ ] Log into the game world
- [ ] Send a command to one or more clients

IDEAS

- Terminal GUI
- Web GUI
- See how much of this can run under WASM

HASHING

What is hashed?
  I think just the TransitHeader (packet header) buffer?
  ACE has code that makes it look like it hashes both the header and the body
What algorithm is used to hash?
Does the server set the seed for the hash?

Some packets are more complicated and use some RNG?

> parad0x: "the isaac rng uses that, and each packet gets a new value from the
gen to use as part of the checksum well, each flagged packet"
