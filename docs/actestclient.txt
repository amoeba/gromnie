How/what does NetworkManager.Send actually do?
- It gets passed in a subclass of Packet, like LoginRequestPacket
- Calls the superclass (Packet) .Serialize method
  - Which serializes the entire packet to a buffer, in two phases
    - First it serializes the fragment data
    - Then it jumps back and serializes the header
    ? Why?
  - and records a length
  ! the serialized buffer is a TransitHeader
- Updates the TransitHeader with connection state (i.e., sequence)
- Hashes the header buffer and sets it
