# Scripting

## Client State

Scripts can access the state of the client in two ways:

1. Listen for client state change events
2. Get a snapshot with self.client()

### Client State Events

TODO: List out events scripts get about the client

### Client Snapshots

TODO

```rs
fn my_script_fun {
  let client = self.clent()
  // TODO: Finish this example
  if client.scene == ... {

  }
}
```
